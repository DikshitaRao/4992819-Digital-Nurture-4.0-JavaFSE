# React Event Examples App

# Overview
This React application demonstrates various event handling techniques in React, including button clicks, form submissions, synthetic events, and passing arguments to event handlers. The app consists of two main components: a Counter and a Currency Converter.

# Features
Counter Component:

Increment and decrement buttons to modify a counter value

Button that invokes multiple methods on click

Button that passes arguments to an event handler

Demonstration of synthetic events

Currency Converter Component:

Form that converts Indian Rupees to Euros

Demonstrates form submission handling

Shows input change events

Key Concepts Demonstrated
Event Handling in React
React events are named using camelCase (e.g., onClick instead of onclick)

Event handlers are passed as functions (not strings)

Events in React are synthetic events that wrap native browser events

Synthetic Events
React normalizes events across different browsers

Events have the same interface as native events

Demonstrated with onMouseDown event

Passing Arguments to Event Handlers
Using arrow functions to pass parameters

Example: onClick={() => sayWelcome('Welcome')}

Multiple Method Invocation
Single event handler can call multiple functions

Example: Increment button calls both incrementCount and sayHello

Form Handling
Controlled components pattern

Form submission with onSubmit

Input change handling with onChange

Customization
You can modify the following aspects of the application:

Styling: Edit App.css to change the visual appearance

Conversion Rate: Update the conversion rate in CurrencyConverter.js

Additional Events: Add more event examples by creating new components

Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues:

Dependency problems:

Delete node_modules and run npm install again

Port already in use:

Either close the other application using port 3000

Or start this app on a different port: PORT=3001 npm start

React not updating:

Ensure you're using state hooks (useState) properly

Check for console errors in developer tools
